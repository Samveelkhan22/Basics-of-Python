#Excercise:2
#(i) What would python print?
# n = 3
# while n > 0:
#     n-=1
# print(n)

#(ii) What would python print?
# n=4
# while n > 0:
#     n+=1
#     print(n)

#(iii) Try the scenario below:
# Program to convert a list into a set

# Defining the list of countries
# countries_list = ["Canada", "USA", "Mexico", "Australia"]

# Converting the list into a set
# countries_set = set(countries_list)

# Displaying the set of countries
# print("The set of countries is:")
# print(countries_set)

#create a loop that counts from 0 to 100
# for i in range(0,101):
#     print(i)

#make a multiplication table using a loop
# Taking input from user
# num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Using for loop to create the multiplication table
# for i in range(1, 11):
#     result = num * i
#     print(f"{num} x {i} = {result}")

#output the numbers 1 to 10 backwards using a loop
# for i in range(10, 0, -1):
#     print(i)

#create a loop that counts all even numbers to 10
# for i in range(2, 11, 2):
#     print(i)

#create a loop that sums the numbers from 100 to 200
# sum = 0
# for i in range(100, 201):
#     sum += i
# print("The sum of numbers from 100 to 200 is:", sum)

#(iii) Make a program that list the countries in the set below using a while loop

# Defining the list of countries
# countries = ["Canada", "USA", "Mexico"]

# Changing the list into set
# country_set = set()
# i = 0
# while i < len(countries):
#     country_set.add(countries[i])
#     i += 1

# Displaying the set of countries
# print("The set of countries is:")
# print(country_set)
