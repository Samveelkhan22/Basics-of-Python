#(I)You have collected information about cities in your province. You decide to store each city’s name, population, and mayor in a file. Write a python program to accept the data for a number of cities from the keyboard and store the data in a file in the order in which they’re entered
# Open the file for writing
# with open("cities.txt", "w") as f:
#     while True:
#         # Prompt the user for city information
#         name = input("Enter city name (or 'quit' to exit): ")
#         if name == "quit":
#             break
#         population = input("Enter city population: ")
#         mayor = input("Enter mayor's name: ")
        
#         # Write the city information to the file
#         f.write(f"{name},{population},{mayor}\n")

#(II)Write a python program to create a data file student.txt and append the message “Now we are AI students”s
# Open the file for appending (or create it if it doesn't exist)
# with open("student.txt", "a") as f:
    # Append the message to the file
    # f.write("Now we are AI students\n")
